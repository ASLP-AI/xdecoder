# X Decoder

XDecoder is a light ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition) decoder framework. 
X means enchanced, fast, and portable. Our target is running 
LVCSR(Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition) on low resourse system,
especially on mobile phones and other embedding device. 

So serveral things should be taken into account.

- **Mini**, the whole package(AM, LM, lib) of the system should be small.
- **Fast**, Recognition speed should be in real time
- **Low power**, which is critical for modern mobile phones.
